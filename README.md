Machine learning model to predict Titanic survival
# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction
Project Overview  
This project builds a **Machine Learning model** to predict whether a passenger survived the **Titanic disaster** based on features like age, gender, class, fare, etc.  

 Dataset  
- **train.csv** â†’ Used for model training.  
- **test.csv** â†’ Used for predictions.  

Data Preprocessing  
1. **Handling Missing Values** â†’ Filled missing `Age` values with median, removed `Cabin` column.  
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables** â†’ Converted `Sex` and `Embarked` to numerical values.  
3. **Feature Scaling** â†’ Standardized `Age` and `Fare`.  

Model Selection  
Trained multiple models and selected the best based on performance:  
Logistic Regression  
Random Forest (Final Model)  
XGBoost
